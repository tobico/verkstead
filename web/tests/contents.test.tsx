//! One nav in two shapes — the sidebar in the wide margin, and the bar with the

//! stylesheet's answer to how wide their window is. These tests ask about the
//! one list both are drawn from, the jump that lands on a folded file, and the
//! highlight that follows the reader down the page.
//!
//! What the browser knows about where the page is scrolled to, jsdom has none
//! of: the scroll-spy's observer is stood in for, so a test says what has
//! crossed the reading line rather than laying out a page to make it happen.
//! What is being asked is what the page does with the answer.
