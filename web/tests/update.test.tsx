//! The Update Notice: the banner the pending page draws when the server says a
//! newer Verkstead has been released than the one serving it.
//!
//! Mounted through the pending list rather than on its own, because where it
//! sits is half of what it is: a banner above the list, in the reading column
//! the list is in. What the server answers with is `UpdateNotice` from
//! `src/api/types.ts`, which `cargo test` writes out of the Rust the endpoint
//! fills in — so a payload written here that the server would never send does
//! not typecheck.
