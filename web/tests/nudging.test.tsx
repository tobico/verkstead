//! The Nudge: the open page being told the pending world moved, and looking

//! worker off a push (ADR-0005).
//!
//! Driven through `App` for the same reason `resuming` is — what the Nudge acts
//! on is the app's own query client, and a test that built a client of its own
//! would be asserting its own arrangement rather than the app's.
