//! The worker relaying a push to the pages that are already open (ADR-0005).
//!
//! A push is the channel that survives what the Nudge stream does not: iOS
//! suspends the PWA and the stream dies with it, while the push service wakes
//! the worker anyway. So every push does two things — it shows its notification,
//! and it tells every open window to look again.
//!
//! The notification is the part that must never be traded away. The subscription
//! was made `userVisibleOnly`, and a push that showed nothing would cost it, so
//! each test here that arranges some difficulty asks about the notification too.
