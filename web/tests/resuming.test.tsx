//! Coming back to the app after it was away — the PWA reopened, the phone
//! unlocked, the tab refocused. The document becoming visible again is the one
//! signal that reliably fires on an iOS PWA resume, and every open page reads
//! itself afresh off it.
//!
//! Driven through `App` rather than through a page on its own, because what is
//! being asked about is the app's own query client: the refetch is that
//! client's doing, and a test that built a client of its own would only be
//! asking about the client it built. Both pages are reached on their real
//! routes, for the same reason.
