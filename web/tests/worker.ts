//! Verkstead's own service worker, run somewhere a test can drive it.
//!
//! `assets/sw.js` is a static file rather than a module of this bundle — vite
//! copies it to the site root untouched, because that is the only place a worker
//! can be served from and still control `/sets/12` — so it is read here as text
//! and evaluated against a stand-in for the global scope a worker is given.
//! Everything it reaches for hangs off that object, so a worker driven here
//! disturbs nothing about the environment the rest of the tests run in.
