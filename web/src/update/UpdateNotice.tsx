//! The Update Notice: the banner above the Repo list, saying that a newer
//! Verkstead has been released than the one serving the page.
//!
//! It informs and nothing else (CONTEXT.md). The link to the instructions is the
//! whole of what it offers — nothing here installs anything, and nothing here
//! changes the server. Nor can it be dismissed: it stands until the server is
//! updated, at which point the server stops saying there is anything to update
//! to and the banner goes with it.
//!
//! Everything but a release waiting is drawn as nothing at all — a server that
//! is current, one that could not find out, and the moment before either has
//! been said. A page that cannot reach the endpoint is the Repo list exactly
//! as it was.
