//! The one on/off control in the UI, wherever a device setting is offered.

//! A checkbox under the paint rather than a button that redraws itself: the
//! browser gives a checkbox the keyboard, the label association and the focus
//! ring for nothing, and `role="switch"` is the one word that tells a screen
//! reader it is a state and not a choice in a set.
//!
//! It says on or off and nothing else. Anything a switch cannot say — that this
//! browser has no push to offer, that a tap failed — is said in words beside it
//! by whoever is showing it, because only they know what to say.
