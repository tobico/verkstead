//! The Archive: every Question Set that has been settled, newest first — the ones
//! that were answered, and the ones the human closed unanswered because nobody
//! was ever going to answer them.
//!
//! A permanent log. A Set lands here by being answered or by being archived
//! unanswered rather than by anyone filing it, and nothing here is ever deleted —
//! which is what the rows are worded for: no Liveness badge, because nothing is
//! waiting on a settled Set, and its time in the words the pending list is
//! scanned in — an age while the settling is fresh, because the top of this
//! list is scanned the same way, and the plain date once it is not, because
//! "400d ago" says nothing about a log. The exact minute rides behind the
//! words as the tooltip. A Set that was never answered says so, because
//! reading it as a decision would be reading a decision nobody made.
