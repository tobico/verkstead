//! Listening for the Nudge: the contentless word that the pending world moved
//! (ADR-0005).
//!
//! There is one reaction and it never varies — look again at everything the
//! page is showing. A Nudge says a Set arrived, was answered or was archived
//! without saying which, because the page would do the same thing either way,
//! and so nothing here has to decide anything.
//!
//! It arrives two ways, and they are not alternatives. The server's stream is
//! instant while the page is alive but dies when iOS suspends the PWA; the
//! service worker relays every push it is woken by, which survives exactly that
//! suspension but needs notifications on and Apple's delivery to happen at all.
//!
//! Nothing here has to work, either. Every Nudge is latency saved off the
//! ten-second poll underneath, and a page that gets none of them stays correct
//! at the poll's pace — which is what makes it safe for this to be a connection
//! that drops, a browser that has no `EventSource` or no worker, or a server
//! that is being restarted.
