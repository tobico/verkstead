//! The attached Diff: what the agent is asking about, shown rather than
//! described.
//!
//! It arrives as HTML the server already rendered — parsed per file,
//! highlighted, and anchored `diff-1`, `diff-2`, … in the order the paths
//! beside it name — so there is nothing here to render and no diff parser in
//! the browser at all. The folds are the browser's own `details`, which is why
//! they work without a line of script.
