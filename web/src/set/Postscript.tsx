//! What the agent closed the Set with, and the human's closing word under it,
//! in one card.
//!
//! The same kind of thing as the Preface and drawn the same way — the agent's
//! markdown, rendered by the server, with a Diagram in it drawn like any other,
//! under a heading of its own that the table of contents offers a way to. What
//! differs is what it is for: the Preface opens the page and this closes it.
//!
//! The heading is named for what the section holds rather than always for the
//! Postscript, because a Set that closed without one still ends here: with no
//! Postscript there is only the box, and `Comment` is what that is.
//!
//! The comment goes *inside* the card rather than after it, because the two are
//! one exchange — what the agent raised and what the human made of it — and a
//! box that trailed the card read as a separate thing that happened to follow
//! it. That is why the card is this section and not the body inside it: the
//! body is filled from the server as raw HTML, so nothing can be placed within
//! it.
//!
//! Here rather than in either page half because both halves draw it: the sheet a
//! waiting Set is filled in on, and the record a settled one is read as. One
//! component means the two cannot drift into drawing it differently.
