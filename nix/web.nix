# The viewer: the SolidJS SPA under `web/`, built by vite to the static files the
# server embeds (ADR-0003), and — with `runTests` on — the same sources put through
# typecheck and vitest instead.
#
# One file for both because they are one build: the same fileset, the same pinned
# node and pnpm, and the same store of dependencies, so a lockfile argument
# between `nix build` and `nix flake check` is not a thing that can happen.
#
# The pnpm store is fetched separately, as a fixed-output derivation named by
# `pnpmDeps.hash` — that is the one step allowed to reach the network, and the
# hash is what says the lockfile has not moved under us. Change `web/package.json`
# or `web/pnpm-lock.yaml` and this hash has to change with them; nix will print
# the one it wanted.
