# The NixOS module put through a Question Set in a VM.
#
# The round trip itself — a Set submitted, a Response posted back, the CLI
# printing it and exiting 0 — is already covered in-process by the crate tests.
# Doing it again here is only worth the VM for what wraps around it, which no
# in-process test can see: a unit that starts itself at boot, a state directory
# systemd creates and hands over, a database that outlives the process that made
# it, a server binary running from the store rather than a working tree, and the
# CLI on `PATH` with nothing set in the environment at all.
#
# Push delivery stays out of scope: it needs the browser vendors' push services,
# which a test VM has no route to. The server's own tests cover what gets sent.
