// from,

//
// It does no caching. Every page is rendered against live SQLite, and a cached
// copy of a Set that has since been answered is worse to the human than a
// failure to load. This listener never answers a request, which leaves the
// browser to fetch it exactly as it would with no worker at all; it is here
// because installability checks still look for a fetch handler.
