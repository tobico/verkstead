//! `verkstead` — the command coding agents run to put a Question Set to the
//! human and block until it is answered.
//!
//! The CLI is the agent-facing compatibility surface (ADR-0001): agents run it
//! as a background shell command, so the wait outlives any harness tool
//! timeout, and nothing but a shell is needed to integrate. It also derives
//! `project`, `branch` and the Diff from the working directory, so those are
//! never at the mercy of what an agent claims.
