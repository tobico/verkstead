//! SQLite persistence for Question Sets, their Responses, and the archiving of
//! the ones nobody will ever answer.
//!
//! A Set and a Response are each kept as one JSON body — JSON rather than YAML
//! because it preserves a Preface's whitespace exactly, and the Preface is
//! markdown the human reads back verbatim. `title`, `project` and `branch` are
//! lifted into columns beside the Set so the pending list can be drawn without
//! deserializing every Set.
//!
//! The store sits below both the agent API and the web UI: the UI's server
//! functions live in the shared `verkstead-app` crate, which cannot reach back
//! into the server binary that links it.
