//! Who is still waiting: the registry of held waits, and the window that turns
//! it into the badge a waiting Set carries.
//!
//! The server knows whether a long-poll is currently held for a Set, because it
//! is the thing holding it. This lives beside [`Settlements`](crate::Settlements)
//! for the same reason that does: the agent API holds the waits and the web UI's
//! server functions read them, and those are different crates that can only meet
//! in this one.
//!
//! Also like `Settlements`, the registry is in-process and not persisted. After
//! a server restart every pending Set reads disconnected until its CLI's next
//! reconnect, which is a second or two away.
//!
//! Liveness is display-only (ADR-0001): nothing here withdraws a Set, refuses an
//! answer to one, or is consulted when a Response is taken.
