//! What the viewer is handed of a Set's own material: the agent's markdown
//! rendered and sanitized, the Diff parsed and highlighted, and the facts about
//! the Set that decide how the page is drawn.
//!
//! These are the content assertions the server-rendered page tests made about
//! the HTML they produced, asked here of the JSON `/api/ui/sets/{id}` answers
//! with instead. That is where they belong: rendering agent-supplied content is
//! the server's job whatever draws the page, and the drawing is the viewer's own
//! tests' subject.
//!
//! The same tests leave the golden fixtures behind — see
//! [`the_viewers_own_tests_are_fed_from_here`]. The viewer's component tests read
//! those files rather than a hand-written mock, so a change to the wire shape
//! that nobody carried across shows up as a failing fixture rather than as a
//! viewer that draws the wrong thing.
