//! What is worth proving here is that this namespace is a way through to the

//! the browser ends a wait an agent is genuinely holding, and not merely that a
//! row appeared. The rendering it answers with is `ui_content.rs`'s subject, and
//! the two things under the same prefix that answer out of neither the store
//! nor the waits are their own files': the Nudge stream, which is listened on
//! rather than asked, is `nudges.rs`'s, and `/api/ui/update` is `updates.rs`'s.
