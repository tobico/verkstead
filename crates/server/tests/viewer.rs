//! The viewer as the browser gets it: the SPA's own files out of the binary, on
//! every path the agents' API has not claimed.
//!
//! Two things are worth proving here, and neither is visible in the bytes. The
//! first is the fallback: the viewer routes on the client, so `/sets/12` is a
//! path only the browser knows about and the server has to answer it with the
//! document rather than a 404 — while a *file* that is not there stays a 404,
//! because a missing bundle answered with HTML is a syntax error at the top of
//! the page instead of an honest miss. The second is how long each answer may be
//! reused: the bundles are named by content and may be kept for a year, and the
//! document that names them has to be revalidated every time, or a browser
//! reuses a page pointing at a build's bundles that are no longer there.
//!
//! The site served here is `tests/site`, embedded the same way the built one is —
//! so none of this waits on `pnpm build`, and the fixture can name a bundle whose
//! hash a test is allowed to know.
