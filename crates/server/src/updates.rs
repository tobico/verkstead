//! Learning that a newer Verkstead has been released.
//!
//! One unauthenticated request to GitHub's latest-release API, at startup and
//! once a day after — server-side rather than from the browser, because a
//! tailnet of devices each asking GitHub would have the whole household phoning
//! home, and because the viewer must not need GitHub to be reachable to draw a
//! page.
//!
//! The verdict is held in memory and nothing is written to the store: it is
//! cheap to work out again, and a server that has just started should ask rather
//! than believe what it concluded a week ago. A poll that fails leaves the last
//! verdict standing and costs nothing — the next cycle asks again.
//!
//! Nothing is ever installed on the human's behalf, and the whole thing can be
//! turned off: with no address to ask, no task is started and no request is ever
//! made.
