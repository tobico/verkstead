//! The viewer, served out of the binary: the SolidJS SPA under `web/`, built by
//! vite and embedded here (ADR-0003).
//!
//! There is no site directory to point the server at and nothing to install
//! beside it — one file is the whole deployment, which is what the tailnet box
//! and the NixOS module both wanted. In a release build the files are compiled
//! in; in a debug build rust-embed reads them off disk on every request, so
//! `pnpm build` is visible to a running `cargo run -p verkstead-cli -- serve`
//! without a recompile.
//!
//! Two decisions live here. The first is the fallback: the viewer routes on the
//! client, so `/sets/12` names no file and has to be answered with the document
//! that carries the router — but a *file* that is missing stays a 404, because a
//! bundle answered with HTML dies as a syntax error at the top of the page
//! instead of reporting a stale URL. The second is how long an answer may be
//! reused, which is [`KEEP`] and [`ASK`] below.
