//! The Nudge: telling the open viewer pages that the pending world moved.
//!
//! A Nudge is contentless (ADR-0005). It says that a Set arrived, was answered
//! or was archived, and never which of the three, because the page's reaction
//! is the same either way — look again at everything it is showing. Nothing
//! here has to be got right for correctness: a Nudge that never lands costs
//! latency, and the ten-second poll underneath collects the change anyway.
//!
//! The durable changes reach this stream over two channels rather than one. A
//! settlement — a Response taken, or a Set closed unanswered — is already
//! announced on [`Settlements`](verkstead_store::Settlements) from inside the
//! store, on the single path the browser's submit and the agent's both take, so
//! listening to it here is what makes it impossible to Nudge about a settlement
//! from one namespace and silently not from the other. Everything else that
//! moves — a Set arriving, a session printing another line of its transcript —
//! is announced on [`Nudges`], which is the channel for what the store has no
//! reason to know has happened.
//!
//! Liveness stays out of it, and so stays with the poll: the
//! waiting/disconnected verdict cycles with the agent's long-poll rather than
//! changing at clean moments, so there is no moment here to broadcast.
