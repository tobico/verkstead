//! The viewer's own JSON namespace: everything the human's browser asks of the
//! server, and nothing an agent ever calls.
//!
//! Kept under `/api/ui/` rather than mixed into `/api/v1/` because the two are
//! different promises. The agent contract is versioned and public to whatever is
//! installed out there, so it changes only by adding; this namespace is private
//! to the viewer that ships in the same binary, and the two of them may be
//! rearranged together whenever it suits.
//!
//! What crosses it is JSON, where the agents' half speaks YAML: the agents' side
//! is read and written by humans in a terminal, and this side is read by a
//! browser. Everything the agent wrote arrives already rendered to sanitized HTML
//! — see [`verkstead_render`] — so the viewer needs no markdown parser, no diff
//! highlighter and no sanitizer of its own.
//!
//! The two mutations answer 200 with a named outcome rather than a status code,
//! including for the Set that has gone: every one of those outcomes is something
//! the viewer has to say to the human in words, and a Set answered from another
//! device is not an error to be retried. What does get a status code is a Set
//! that cannot be read at all — a 404, because that is a page the viewer draws
//! differently.
