//! Telling the devices that a Question Set has arrived.
//!
//! One push per subscribed device, encrypted for that device's own keys and
//! signed with the VAPID identity the store generated on first run. The body is
//! small on purpose: enough for the service worker to draw the notification and
//! to know which Set to open, and nothing that would put a Question in a
//! notification the phone shows on a lock screen.
//!
//! Sending happens behind the answer to `POST …/api/v1/sets`, never in front of
//! it. Delivery goes out through the browser vendors' push services, which is
//! the one place Verkstead reaches the public internet, and none of it is
//! reliable enough to make an agent's submission depend on: a service that
//! cannot be reached costs a notification, not the Set.
//!
//! A push service is also the only thing that can tell us a device has gone —
//! the app was uninstalled, the subscription expired — and it says so with a
//! `404` or a `410`. Those are pruned. Everything else, a timeout or a `503`,
//! is a notification lost and the device is left alone.
