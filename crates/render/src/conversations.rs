//! wire does — the parser and the sanitizer are the server's, and the viewer only
//! puts HTML in the page. Its source travels beside the HTML, because the Brief
//! is the one document on this wire the human edits: a page that had to unrender
//! it to fill the field would need a parser after all.
//!
//! The Timeline is a list of Events with a kind, not a Brief and a list. The
//! Brief is the only kind there is yet; agent output, Question Sets and commits
//! are variants added beside it, and a Timeline shaped around its first Event
//! would have to be taken apart to hold the second.
