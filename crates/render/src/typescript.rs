//! Writing the viewer's TypeScript out of the Rust it is generated from.
//!
//! Every type on the viewer's side of the wire is described once, in Rust, and
//! `web/src/api/types.ts` is written from those descriptions — so the two
//! languages cannot come to disagree about a field. The file is committed, and
//! rewritten by every `cargo test`: what says whether anything moved is the diff.
//!
//! The roots are listed here rather than each type carrying its own `#[ts(export)]`
//! for two reasons. One is that the list *is* the viewer's wire surface, and a
//! list is a thing that can be read; a type that no endpoint hands over has no
//! business in the bindings. The other is mechanical: `#[ts(export)]` generates a
//! test in the crate the type is defined in, and two crates' test binaries are
//! two processes, which would race to create the one file and each write half of
//! it. Exporting from here writes it once, in one process — dependencies and all,
//! including the Set types over in `verkstead-schema`.
